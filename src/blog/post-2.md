## 3D printed stand for my off-brand charger

When I picked up a knockoff MagSafe wireless charger for my iPhone, I didnâ€™t realize it wouldnâ€™t fit the usual MagSafe charging stands made for Appleâ€™s official charger. Itâ€™s just a bit biggerâ€”about 6 cm in diameterâ€”which meant none of the existing stands worked. 

I wanted a charger stand to take advantage of the iPhone's StandBy mode, but I wasn't willing to shell out the $100+ ðŸ¤¢ it would cost for an official charger and stand. 

So, I fired up the old 3D printer and made my own.

There were a few hiccups along the way. I experienced a couple of catastrophic print failures, and my initial design ended up being just too small to fit the charger.

Luckily, I was able to get a near-perfect print after making a few tweaks to the design and adjustments to my printer. Leveling my bed was likely the most important printer adjustment, but I also switched to a magnetic PEI build plate during this project.

This was one of my first real 3D modeling projects, and honestly, Iâ€™m pretty proud of how it turned out. The stand holds the charger at just the right angle to work with Appleâ€™s StandBy mode, and Iâ€™ve used it nightly to charge my phone for over six months without a single issue. Solid, stable, and super functional.

To keep the base from sliding around on smooth surfaces, I added four small indents underneath that perfectly fit 8 mm adhesive bumper pads. With those in place, it stays put on a desk or nightstand like a champ.

If you're using a knockoff MagSafe charger like mine, or one with a similar size (6 cm diameter), feel free to [download my design from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6955377).
