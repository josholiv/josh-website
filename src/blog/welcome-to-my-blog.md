## Hello, my name is Josh! But I'd be surprised
if you didn't know that already, given the site you're on (though if you somehow, inexplicably, got super lost while surfing the righteous and gnarly waves of the world wide web ü§ô and unwittingly washed up on my site before knowing my name, check out my [About](https://josholivier.com/about) page). 

First and foremost, I hope you enjoy this photo of me holding a chicken:

## Now that that's out of the way, welcome to my blog! 

This is where I plan to post things like the thoughts and ideas that come to my mind and wake me up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. You know, things like code snippets, 3D printing ideas, and my horrible, intrusive, and nightmarish recurring memory of losing the middle school spelling bee on the word Pompeii (I will never forgive them for giving me a proper noun üò°). Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll even share a cooking recipe or two. 

Due to the nature of my current job‚Äîa lab manager in a human neuroimaging research lab‚Äîand many of my hobbies, I spend a lot of my time learning new things. My hope is that I can share some of these things here in way that's at least slightly better than a chaotic, stream-of-consciousnesses mess. Some of the topics I may touch on in future posts are: 

- 3D-printing stuff
- Web development with Astro and stuff
- Triathlon training stuff
- Yoyo stuff
- Psychology and neuroscience stuff

I may also make posts about other topics, and I may not end up posting about all of the topics listed above. The general idea, at least for now, is to post about specific things I've learned how to do after struggling for hours‚Äîbanging my head against the keyboard‚Äîto find answers and resources elsewhere on the internet. 

## My primary goal, as I add content 
to this blog, is to follow the wise words of one of the greatest leaders in history: 

> ‚ÄúThe most important part of making a blog is having fun along the way.‚Äù
>
> > -Abraham Lincoln

Though I'm not an expert on any of these topics by any means, I hope my perspective can be helpful, or at the very least, entertaining‚Äîwhether you're laughing with me or at me. So without further ado, let‚Äôs kick back, grab one of those fancy brewed craft root beers that comes in a vintage glass bottleüçª, and get this party started, baby.
