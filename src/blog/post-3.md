## An age-old problem

I used to have tons of yoyos everywhere on my desk, cluttering up all my workspace—after all, who doesn't? Well, my desk is cluttered no more! I designed this stand to organize and display them better while still keeping my throws within arm's reach in case of emergency.

## The design process

The goal was to make something compact and stable that would fit most modern yoyos (up to ~52 mm wide). I also wanted a clean, minimalist look. I modeled each slot with just enough clearance to make it easy to pick up and set down a yoyo without them rolling off. The base is wide and flat to prevent tipping over, even when all three slots are filled.

I added six circular recesses on the underside of the base to hold six 8 mm adhesive bumper pads. These help keep the stand from sliding around and also protect your desk surface from scratches.

## Printing & assembly

I printed mine in PLA with a layer height of 0.2 mm. I printed with supports—only in the bumper pad indents—just in case, though if you enjoy living on the edge, you should be able to get away with printing without them if your printer is well-calibrated. It came out super clean and it's solid enough to feel durable.

Once it was printed, I stuck on the 8 mm bumper pads, popped in a few of my favorite yoyos, and voilà—instant upgrade from my yoyo desk clutter nightmare.

## Finishing touches

While not entirely necessary, the bumper pads make a huge difference in stability and work perfectly for protecting my desk from potential scratches. They really elevate the design and give the display stand a much more premium feel. Overall, I'm really happy with how it turned out.
