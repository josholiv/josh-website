# My porfolio site and blog

I created this site ([josholivier.com](https://josholivier.com/)) by following the [Build your first Astro Blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). 

Originally, I just meant for this site to be a basic landing page for my CV, but as I worked through the tutorial I warmed up to the idea of making it into a blog as well, where I can post things related to my work projects and hobbies. 

I deploy my site via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).


## Resources

Both [Astro's documentation](https://docs.astro.build) and [Discord server](https://astro.build/chat) have been immensely helpful as I've gone through the process of learning code and building my site from scratch.
